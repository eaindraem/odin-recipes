    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Meet my favorite fried egg: the crispy olive oil fried egg. 
        These fried eggs have golden, lacy, crispy edges, which contrast beautifully 
        with their runny yellow yolks. Contrast is everything!
    </p>
    <p>
        Start with a good egg, a hot skillet, and a generous drizzle of olive oil, 
        and you'll end up with the most flavorful fried egg you've ever tasted. 
        They are infinitely better than the rubbery, sulfurous eggs that come 
        out of non-stick skillets. In fact, 
        these are the only fried eggs I ever want to eat.
